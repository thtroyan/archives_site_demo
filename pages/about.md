## About the Collection

The Queer Film Archival Project began as an attempt by creator Thomas Troyan to create
a centralized collection. Beginning as a personal collection constituting of home media
releases it eventually expanded to a larger size after receiving outside support in the form of
material donations.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
